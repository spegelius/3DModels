# What?

An enclosure for Chia mining. Holds up to 16 2.5" USB3 disks (like Toshiba Canvio Basic 4T), Raspberry Pi3/4 and your choice of USB-hub (recommend 16-port I-tec).
Size is 2U, with depth of ~470mm. Printable with printers that have ~220x220 bed (some parts might be bigger...).
Mostly printed, requires some M3 screws, M3 nuts, M8 threaded rods, M8 nuts and M8 washers. Also 2x80mm fans to keep things cool.


# How?
Proper instructions still a TODO, but in OpenSCAD check the mockup()-function which should explain how the parts are meant to fit together.
